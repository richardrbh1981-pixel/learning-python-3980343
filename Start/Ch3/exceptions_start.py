# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for working with Exceptions
#

# Errors can happen in programs, and we need a clean way to handle them
# This code will cause an error because you can't divide by zero:
# x = 10/0
# Exceptions provide a way of catching errors and then handling them in 
# a separate section of the code to group them together
# try:
#   x = 10/0
# except :
#   print("Whoops, you can't divide by zero!")

# You can also catch specific exceptions
try:
  answer = input("Enter a number to divide by 10:")
  num = int(answer)
  print("10 divided by", num, "is", 10/num)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
  print("Whoops, you can't divide by zero!", e)
except ValueError as e:
  print("That looks kind of funny. You need to enter a number! Error:", e)
finally:
  print("Finally, The code will always run")
