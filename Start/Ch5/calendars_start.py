import calendar

# create a plain text calendar
c = calendar.TextCalendar(calendar.MONDAY)
thestr = c.formatmonth(2026, 1, 0, 0)
print(thestr)

# create an HTML formatted calendar
# hc = calendar.HTMLCalendar(calendar.MONDAY)
# thestr = hc.formatmonth(2026, 1, 0)
# print(thestr)

# loop over the days of a month
# zeroes mean that the day of the week is in an overlapping month
# for i in c.itermonthdays(2026,8):
#   print(i)
  
# The Calendar module provides useful utilities for the given locale,
# such as the names of days and months in both full and abbreviated forms
# for name in calendar.month_name:
#   print(name)

# for day in calendar.day_name:
#   print(day)

# Calculate days based on a rule: For example, consider
# a team meeting on the first Friday of every month.
# To figure out what days that would be for each month,
# we can use this script:
# print("Team meeting will bo on: ")
# for m in range(1,13):
#   cal = calendar.monthcalendar(2026, m)
#   week1 = cal[0]
#   week2 = cal[1]
#   if week1[calendar.FRIDAY] != 0:
#     meetday = week1[calendar.FRIDAY]
#   else:
#     meetday = week2[calendar.FRIDAY]

#   print(f"{calendar.month_name[m]} {meetday}, 2026")
