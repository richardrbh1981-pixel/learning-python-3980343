x = 0

# define a while loop
# while x < 5:
#   print(x)
#   x = x + 1

# answer = input("Should I stop")
# while answer != "yes":
#   print(answer)
#   answer = input("Should I stop")
  
# define a for loop
days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wenseday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

# for d in days:
#   print(d)

# use a for loop over a collection

# for d in days:
#   if (d == "Thursday"):
#   print(d)

# use the break and continue statements
# for d in days:
#   if (d == "Thursday"):
#     continue
#   print(d)

# using the enumerate() function to get an index and an item
for i, d in enumerate(days):
  print(i, d)
