x = 0

# define a while loop

#   x = x + 1

#   answer = input("should I stop?")

# define a for loop
# days = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri","sat","sun"]
# for d in days:
#   print(d)
# use a for loop over a collection


# use the break and continue statements

# using the enumerate() function to get an index and an item
